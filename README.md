# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection is a critical area in the financial sector, as fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses and damage to a company's reputation. This paper explores various techniques and methodologies for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Traditional methods, such as rule-based systems, are often inadequate due to their inability to adapt to new fraud patterns. Therefore, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models have become the cornerstone of modern fraud detection systems, offering the ability to learn from historical data and detect anomalies in real-time. Techniques like decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble methods have shown promising results in improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives. The paper discusses the challenges of imbalanced datasets, privacy concerns, and the evolving nature of fraud schemes. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation in developing an effective fraud detection system. The integration of these advanced techniques is critical for developing robust, scalable solutions that can effectively prevent and mitigate credit card fraud.

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.
